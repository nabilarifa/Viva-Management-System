# Viva-Management-System

This is a web application for viva management in SUST. The teacher can create a new viva, add students based on their registration number, end the viva, create a question bank for the students, end the viva, comment on students' answers to each question. Students can enter a viva if they are allowed; otherwise, they can only see the viva's schedule. There's a board for upcoming, running, and finished viva.
